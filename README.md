## 2024 National Data Science Competition by RIMAI: License Plate Recognition in Mauritania - Data Science Phase

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the second phase of the 2024 National Data Science Competition hosted by RIMAI, focusing on License Plate Recognition in Mauritania. This phase challenges participants to apply their data science skills to develop robust models for automatic license plate recognition under various conditions.

### Project Overview

After gathering diverse and high-quality images in the first phase, this stage is dedicated to developing and fine-tuning algorithms for the automatic recognition of Mauritanian license plates. The competition aims to test the effectiveness of these algorithms in real-world scenarios, pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning in the context of Mauritanian license plate recognition.

### Repository Structure

- `Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-using-YOLOv8/`: Cloned repository containing YOLOv8 implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the project.
- `.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full pipeline of loading, processing, and outputting license plate data.

### Setup and Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoustaphaCheikhJidou/LicensePlateRecognition
   cd LicensePlateRecognition


2. Clone and Setup YOLOv8 Repository Clone the YOLOv8 repository and install its dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Zeerak-Khan/Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-using-YOLOv8.git
    cd Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-using-YOLOv8
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    !pip install ultralytics

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook to begin experimenting:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    

### Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to process images from the specified directories in your Google Drive, detect license plates, and output recognized plate numbers. The notebook is designed to be intuitive and easy to use for participants at all levels.
