## 2024 National Data Science Competition by RIMAI: License Plate Recognition in Mauritania - Data Science Phase

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the second phase of the 2024 National Data Science Competition hosted by RIMAI, focusing on License Plate Recognition in Mauritania. This phase challenges participants to apply their data science skills to develop robust models for automatic license plate recognition under various conditions.

### Project Overview

After gathering diverse and high-quality images in the first phase, this stage is dedicated to developing and fine-tuning algorithms for the automatic recognition of Mauritanian license plates. The competition aims to test the effectiveness of these algorithms in real-world scenarios, pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning in the context of Mauritanian license plate recognition.

### Repository Structure

- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the project.
- `Second phase notebook JIDDOU26.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full pipeline of loading, processing, and outputting license plate data.
- `test notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook designed to test the pipeline on a specific image.

### Setup and Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoustaphaCheikhJidou/LicensePlateRecognition
   cd LicensePlateRecognition


2. install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt    
    pip install ultralytics
    

### Usage

Run `Second phase notebook JIDDOU26.ipynb` to regenerate submission.csv and to generate the final_phase_images directory, which contains the generated images with a box around the license plate and the reading results. 

Run `test notebook.ipynb` to test on a specific image.
